2. Modify Listing 15.11 so that the two exception types are classes derived from the
logic_error class provided by the <stdexcept> header file. Have each what()
method report the function name and the nature of the problem.The exception
objects need not hold the bad values; they should just support the what() method.
3. This exercise is the same as Programming Exercise 2, except that the exceptions
should be derived from a base class (itself derived from logic_error) that stores the
two argument values, the exceptions should have a method that reports these values
as well as the function name, and a single catch block that catches the base-class
exemption should be used for both exceptions, with either exception causing the
loop to terminate.
4. Listing 15.16 uses two catch blocks after each try block so that the nbad_index
exception leads to the label_val() method being invoked. Modify the program so
that it uses a single catch block after each try block and uses RTTI to handle
invoking label_val() only when appropriate.
